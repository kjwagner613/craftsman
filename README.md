## ðŸ“¦ Kevinâ€™s Portfolio  
A responsive, React-based personal portfolio crafted with modular utility architecture, scoped styling, and a custom layout system for clear scalability and expressive design.

### ðŸ”§ Built With  
- React (JSX + hooks)  
- Tailwind-inspired scoped utility design  
- Modular `.util.js` architecture  
- Custom layout abstraction (`layout.centerCol`)  
- Subtle CSS transitions & scroll-triggered animations  
- Photoshop-crafted cloud vignette assets  

### ðŸ§  Design Philosophy  
Every elementâ€”from the coral-lavender sky to the contact vignetteâ€”is intentional. This project blends **clean engineering** with **visual storytelling**, reflecting my approach as both a developer and designer.

### ðŸ§° Folder Structure Highlights  
- `components/` â†’ reusable page components (Hero, Projects, etc.)  
- `utils/` â†’ helper functions, animation triggers, interaction handlers  
- `styles/` â†’ scoped layout logic with `centerCol`, z-index layering, and responsive breakpoints  

### ðŸŒ€ Visual System  
- Gradient-sky theme carried across [LinkedIn banner](#) and portfolio header  
- KW medallion logo system with layered export and dynamic tone shifting  
- Responsive navbar with custom transition timing and subtle motion cues
