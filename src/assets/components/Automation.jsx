<h2>History in Automation</h2>
<p>From the moment I joined Freudenberg Medical as Master Data Migration Manager, I naturally became the person teams relied on for custom solutions, whether for SAP conversion tasks or broader IT challenges. As part of the SAP implementation team, I traveled between sites, assisting stakeholders and refining operations.</p>
<p>When I later built the PMO, I had become the trusted resource for over 1,200 users seeking "out-of-catalog" assistance in software configuration. As Cloud Specialist, I didn’t just advise—I implemented solutions that streamlined workflows and reduced inefficiencies across the organization.</p>
<p>SAP implementations are high-stakes, with costs second only to the risk of a failed rollout. To mitigate this, I worked exclusively within the corporate tech stack, leveraging Microsoft products under the E5 license to ensure long-term scalability and security. Every site continues to operate successfully, reinforcing the value of automation-driven efficiency.</p>
<h2>Automated Processes Using Microsoft Power Platform</h2>
<p>I developed systems that cut unnecessary steps, saved time, and improved accuracy for key business functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HR New Employee Onboarding → Streamlined employee setup for a seamless transition.</li>
  <li>HSE Good Catch Site Reporting → Automated risk logging and notifications for safety managers.</li>
  <li>Project Management Metrics → Generated performance tracking dashboards for leadership.</li>
  <li>GROWTTH Kaizen Certification Metrics → Centralized progress tracking for continuous improvement.</li>
  <li>CPIM PMO Metric Presentations → Created automated reporting pipelines for executive visibility.</li>
  <li>Client Access for Product Development → Designed secure portals to enhance customer collaboration.</li>
</ul>
