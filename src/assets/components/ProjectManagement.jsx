<h2>Project Management & Software Development</h2>
<p>Project management is the bridge between vision and execution, integrating people, processes, and technology to achieve a shared objective. Having worked alongside top industry professionals, I’ve learned that no two projects are alike—each requires agility, strategic planning, and proactive risk mitigation to ensure successful outcomes.</p>

<h2>Software Development & Project Management Alignment</h2>
<p>While some view planning in software development as a formality, I see the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as an iterative, milestone-driven process, closely aligned with project management.</p>
<p>In highly regulated industries, I’ve structured SDLC phases to reflect tangible project milestones:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requirements → Stakeholder Alignment</li>
  <li>Development → Team Execution</li>
  <li>Testing → Risk Mitigation</li>
  <li>Deployment → Delivery & Implementation</li>
  <li>Maintenance → Long-Term Optimization</li>
</ul>
<h2>History in Project Management</h2>
<p>My journey into project management began in 1996 at Electric Entertainment, where I led a high-stakes emergency relocation requiring the entire company to move between the close of business Friday and reopening Monday. I handled systems engineering, infrastructure design, installation, scheduling, budgeting, and resource allocation, ensuring seamless continuity. This experience reinforced a key truth: effective project management depends on continuous stakeholder communication.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve led major infrastructure projects, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NBC Burbank: KNBC Post-Production facility upgrade ($1.5M)</li>
  <li>Cimarron Bacon Obirien: AVID non-linear editing conversion ($1M)</li>
  <li>Storm Studios: Online broadcast asset distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, I pursued PMI training & certification (PMBOK v5, 2015-2016) to further refine my project management expertise.</p>
<p>At Freudenberg Medical, I expanded my project management scope:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Created PMO for the newly projectized CPIM department.</li>
  <li>Developed custom SharePoint PM tools & trained new PMs using Microsoft Power Platform.</li>
  <li>Managed up to 7 concurrent IT projects for 6 years.</li>
  <li>Led cloud migration across 6 global sites.</li>
  <li>Oversaw Microsoft Copilot rollout, ensuring smooth adoption across the organization.</li>
</ul>
